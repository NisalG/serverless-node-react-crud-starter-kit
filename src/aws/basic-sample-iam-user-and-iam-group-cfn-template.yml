# Here's a basic CloudFormation template for creating an IAM user and an IAM group:
# In this template, an IAM group resource named "MyIAMGroup" is created with the specified group name "my-group".
# An IAM user resource named "MyIAMUser" is also created with the specified user name "my-user". The user is added to the IAM group by referencing the MyIAMGroup resource using !Ref MyIAMGroup.
# Once you have the CloudFormation template ready, you can deploy it using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.

Resources:
  MyIAMGroup:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Group
    Properties:
      GroupName: my-group

  MyIAMUser:
    Type: AWS::IAM::User
    Properties:
      UserName: my-user
      Groups:
        - !Ref MyIAMGroup
